### Team Profile Generator

## Description
A generator to add members of your team, emails, ids, github, office number, and school attending.

## Instructions
Enter the employees name, id, email, and what position they are (manager, engineer, or student) then depending on their status a question related to that status will pop up. Answer that question and then you will have the choice to add another employee or stop. The employees info will then be stored and displayed on a card.
